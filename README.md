##finder update

This is a program designed to find files on your computer.
It will go through drive letter C: and E:
You can edit what drives it goes through in the batch file "finder update 1.04"

###Small note

finder update 1.04 needs to be runned first before clicking on finder 2.07

#How it works

finderFormatHTML.exe takes an input file and the name of an output file with an extension of ".html"<br>
This can be a standalone file, that converts any txt document into a list of links.

It is then readable by your preferred browser and clickable. 
<br>Note in some cases in chrome it will actually download the file...
